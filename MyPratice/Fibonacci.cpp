In this program:
- We take input from the user for the number of terms (`n`) in the Fibonacci series.
- We define a function `fibonacci(int n)` to generate the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.
- Inside the `fibonacci` function, we initialize the first two terms of the series as `0` and `1`.
- We then use a loop to generate the next term by adding the previous two terms (`term1` and `term2`), and update the values of `term1` and `term2` accordingly.
- The loop continues until we reach the specified number of terms (`n`).
- Each term of the Fibonacci series is printed during the loop. */
